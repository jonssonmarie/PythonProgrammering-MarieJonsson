Simple Travian
Travian is a strategy game where you collect resources (lumber, clay, iron, crop) 
to build up a city and spawn troops to pillage and attack other villages. 
Now we will use OOP to represent a very simple village. 
It shall have at least these features:

4 fields
1 crop
1 clay
1 lumber
1 iron

Each field produces 4 units of that resource per hour. Just need to represent it, no need to count the time.
Be able to add and subtract resources -> overload the plus and minus operators
There shall be a max capacity of 800 for each resource in the warehouse stocks
__repr__ method to represent the production rate and current stock.
Use composition and/or inheritance in a strategic way.
Feel free to go beyond and implement more features.
