Create classes following this UML: see picture in github

Note that the method info() should be different in the different classes where it should be implemented.

Use the following code to test your program:
pokemon = TV_serie("Pokemon", "Cartoon", 4.5, 550)
titanic = Movie("Titanic", "Romance", 4.7, 194)
code = Documentary("The Code", "Math", 4)


for video in tuple((pokemon, titanic, code)):
    print(video.info())


An example output could be:
TV series with title Pokemon, genre Cartoon, rating 4.5 and episodes 550
Movie with title Titanic, genre Romance, rating 4.7, duration 194 minutes
Video with title The Code, genre Math and rating 4
