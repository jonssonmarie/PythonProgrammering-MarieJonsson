Dice rolls convergence
Simulate:
  a) 100 dice rolls and count the number of outcome six.
  b) 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000 dice rolls. 
     Count the number of outcome six in each simulation and store it in a list. 
     Compute the probability of outcome six in each simulation. 
  c)   Use matplotlib to plot this list.
