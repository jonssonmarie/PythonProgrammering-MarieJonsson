"""
Encryption 
Let the user input a word and:
  a) encrypt the message by replacing each letter with the next letter. 
     If the letter is in the end of the alphabet, use the first letter instead.
     e.g. in Swedish: "h√∂st" $\rightarrow$ "iatu"
  b) decrypt the message
  c) let the user choose either encryption or decryption.
