Change
Create a function that takes a value as input parameter and print out 
the banknotes and coins in Swedish currency representing this value. 
For example 5289 would give the following printout:

5st 1000-lapp
1st 200-lapp
1st 50-lapp
1st 20-lapp
1st 10-krona
1st 5-krona
2st 2-krona
Now let the user input a value, and use the function to calculate the change.

Jag lade med lite fler valÃ¶rer
